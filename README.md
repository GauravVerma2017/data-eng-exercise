# Data Engineer: Coding Exercise

This is a coding exercise to help us assess candidates looking to join the Data Science & Engineering team at Cond√© Nast.

The test is intended to be completed at home, and we expect you to spend no more than 1-2 hours on it.
If you do not have time to fully complete the exercise or you get stuck, that's fine and not entirely unexpected, just send us as much as you have done. 
We look forward to talking about your experiences.

We understand that your time is valuable, and appreciate any time that you contribute towards building a strong team here.
If you really cannot spare the time, you may want to take a look at Option 2.

## Option 1

Implement an Airflow ([Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/)) DAG to process data from two separate sources and merge it into a single output file.  The DAG should run on a daily basis.  For the purpose of the exercise, both input and output can use the local file system.

Folders `input_source_1/` and `input_source_2/` will contain the input data. 
You can assume that a new file will appear daily in each of those folders, with the filename specifying the date of the data it contains. 
Source 1 data is expected to arrive between 1-3am the following day, in JSON format, while Source 2 data is expected to arrive between 4-5am, in CSV format (e.g. data_20210125.json will appear in the folder on January 26th between 1am and 3am, and engagement_20210125.csv will appear on January 26th between 4am and 5am).
See the sample files provided to familiarise yourself with their format and structure.

The DAG should write to a CSV file the following: date, post id, shares, comments, and likes. All other fields should be ignored.  

Although the sample files are small, your program should be designed such that it could be used in the future to merge large files.

It is totally permitted to make use of any sample code, libraries or other resources available on the internet. Directly copying someone else's answer to this exact question is not advisable.

## Option 2

If you have some personal code, or open source contribution, that you would be prepared to share with us, we can assess that instead.  The code should meet the following criteria:

- It should be at least 1-2 hours of your own work
- Ideally, it should involve an element of data processing
- It should demonstrate how you approach a problem
- It should be something that you are able to discuss with us

# Delivery

You can submit your code however you want - send the details to your point of contact.  
Please include a README containing your thoughts, and any setup instructions (if applicable) and keep the setup steps simple.
